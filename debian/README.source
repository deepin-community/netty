Information about netty
-----------------------

This package was debianized using the mh_make command
from the maven-debian-helper package.

The build system uses Maven but prevents it from downloading
anything from the Internet, making the build compliant with
the Debian policy.

The netty-all.jar is intentionally empty to optimize the size
of the package. It's pom depends on the other netty artifacts,
such that using it in a Maven project is equivalent to the
non empty version.
